I added bootstrap components from an existing bootstrap CSS and JS files on CDN server. 
I downloaded a template but the code inside of it was a bit messy so instead of integrating components from there I decided to use 
separate bootstrap components. The original code has been altered with new components but the purpose and functionality remains the same as per
tasks in Lecture 6. Code has been debugged and no errors were found.
